# C# Minesweeper
 C# implementation of the minesweeper game.
 
## Rules

- Click on one of the boxes to display the number of mines located around it.
- The game is lost if you click on a mine.
- Right-clicking on a square places a flag.
- You can chose the percentage of mines before starting a game, it gets harder with more mines.

The number of remaining mines appears at the top right of the screen.
**Good luck!**

## About

This game was made for testing purposes.

The idea was mainly to manipulate a grid and respect the rules of the deminer. The graphical interface uses images and is perhaps not done in the best way but it works fine!
